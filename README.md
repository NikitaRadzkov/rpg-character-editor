# My React Project
This is a starter template for creating a React project using Yarn and Vite.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/NikitaRadzkov/rpg-character-editor.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```

3. Install dependencies:

  yarn install
```

4. Start the development server:
```shell
  yarn dev
```

5. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:5174/.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5174/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the dist folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`yarn serve`

The yarn preview command starts a local development server with hot-reloading enabled.
Open http://localhost:4173 to view it in the browser.
